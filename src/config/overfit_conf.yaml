  query_nums: 64 # Q is a hyperparameyter (Q need to satisfy Q<=N=h*w/p^2 ! where (h,w) is the resolution of the output feature map S from the

  dim_feedforward: 512 # this is used as hyperparameter for the TransformerEncoderLayer in depth decoder.

  max_depth: 80.0 # this is the max depth used to calculate the center depths of the bins (see formula (7) from the paper).
